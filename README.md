## Information

A project for web scraping weekly schedules from a website.
Good for iterating over multiple websites, and exporting schedules in a CSV format.

I originally developed this code during college to compile a CSV file. The aim of this was to keep all of my schedules in one easilly accessible file.

Basic configurations are present, but any specific changes will require hard-coding to the website layout for functional/efficient data pulling.
