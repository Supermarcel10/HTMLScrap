# HTML Work Scraping Tool

<p style="color:red">Discontinued personal project written in Python.<br>
Depreciated due to newer version in the used modules.</p>

## Information

I developed this code in order to compile a .CSV file of all my schedules into one file.<br>
This came in handy when working whilst studying.

The program will go over the inputted links with different modes of scraping data.<br>
It will then pull the required data and output it into one or multiple files depending on the setup.
